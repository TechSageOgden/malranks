MAL RANKS Project

This project will send a request the MAL API and recieve the top ten anime currently airing. This
project will be slightly more complex than previous projects in this level due to API keys and
my desire for better UI/UX and cleaner design.

API Endpoint :: https://api.myanimelist.net/v2/anime/ranking?ranking_type=airing&limit=10

Required Header 
    X-MAL-CLIENT-ID = SECRET_ID
